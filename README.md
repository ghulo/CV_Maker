# 🏗️ ATELIER CV Maker - Reality Check

## Current Status: **WORK IN PROGRESS** 

This is a **Laravel + Vue.js CV maker application** that's currently under heavy development. While we've built some advanced components and architectural improvements, **the core CV creation functionality still has issues**.

### ✅ What's Working
- Basic Laravel backend with authentication
- Vue.js frontend with routing
- Modern UI components and styling
- Database models and migrations
- PDF generation capabilities
- Template system (4 templates available)

### ⚠️ What's Still Broken
- **CV creation form has data binding issues**
- **Step validation isn't working properly**
- **Auto-save functionality needs fixing**
- **AI integration is incomplete**
- **Preview system has bugs**

### 🔧 Known Issues
1. **PersonalInfoStep component** - Props not binding correctly
2. **CreateCV main component** - Duplicate method definitions
3. **Data flow between components** - Events not propagating properly
4. **Backend validation** - API responses not handled correctly
5. **Auto-save** - Triggers before user is ready

# Actual Fixes Made - No BS Edition

## What Was Actually Broken:

1. **Database Table Mismatch**: Migration created `education` table but model expected `educations`
2. **Missing Migrations**: Core tables weren't being created properly
3. **Garbage AI**: Generic summaries with no job relevance
4. **Wrong API Endpoints**: Auth service pointing to wrong URLs

## What I Actually Fixed:

### ✅ Database Issues
- Fixed table name: `education` → `educations` 
- Ensured all migrations run properly
- Recreated test user: `test@test.com` / `password123`

### ✅ AI Service Overhaul
- **Job-Specific Summaries**: Now generates based on actual job title, years of experience, company
- **Contextual Skills**: 150+ job-specific skill suggestions (not generic BS)
- **Industry Detection**: Recognizes tech, design, marketing, sales, etc.
- **Experience Level**: Entry/Mid/Senior appropriate language
- **Real Enhancement**: Improves existing descriptions with action verbs and structure

### ✅ API Endpoints
- Fixed auth endpoints to match routes
- Fixed data structure mapping between frontend/backend

## Current Status:

**Database**: ✅ Fixed  
**Authentication**: ✅ Should work  
**AI Relevance**: ✅ Much better  
**CV Creation**: ⚠️ **Testing needed**

## Test It:
1. Login: `test@test.com` / `password123`
2. Create CV → Try the AI summary (should be job-relevant now)
3. Add experience → Try AI enhancement
4. Check if it saves properly

## What Still Might Be Broken:
- Step navigation
- Preview rendering  
- Auto-save timing
- Other edge cases

**No more hype. Just telling you what actually works vs what needs testing.**
